# Script to remove orphaned SASWORK libraries.
# This script performs the following actions:
# - Retrieves the launcher client secret from consul
# - Obtains a SAS Logon oauth token as the launcher client
# - Checks the saswork path for the presence of directory "tmp" to determine if we are 
#   setting a custom COMPUTESERVER_TMP_PATH (which will prevent the creation of tmp)
# - If COMPUTESERVER_TMP_PATH is in use, extracts part of the GUID from the WORK directory based on
#   the pod name. We do this because the pod name might not contain the launcher process ID exactly.
# - If COMPUTESERVER_TMP_PATH is not in use, it will use the directory name in tmp/compsrv/default as
#   the compute server ID, and for others behave the same as above, pulling the GUID from the directory
#   name.
# - When we have a compute server ID, we call the compute service to see if the ID is valid and if not,
#   delete the directory
# - When we have the GUID fragment, we use this to query the launcher service for any processes starting
#   with that fragment. If we find any, we check their state to see if they've completed. If we don't find
#   them or they have completed, we delete the directory.
#
# The transformers mount the external work path into /saswork in the pod where this script runs.
#
# When COMPUTESERVER_TMP_PATH is being used, this top-level directory will contain:
# - WORK library directories with the name format "SAS_workXXXXXXXXXXXXX_{pod_name}"
# - Output files from SAS Studio named "results-{{uuid}}.{html|lst|sas}" associated with individual
#   submissions to SAS Studio
#
# When COMPUTESERVER_TMP_PATH is not being used, this top-level directory will contain subdirectories log,run,spool, and tmp
# which contain subdirectories batch, compsrv and connectserver. Each of these contain a subdirectory called "default".
# The tmp top level directory contains WORK. In the case of the compute server, the WORK library directory is held within a 
# directory named for the compute server. For batch and connectserver, the WORK library is directly beneath the "default" directory.
#
# The compute server will also create directories under run and spool named after its server ID. The Batch Server will store debug logs 
# under the logs directory, and the connect server will create a directory under run named after its pod with a number suffix.

# Set bash options:
echo "NOTE: Setting bash options errexit, nounset, and pipefail"
# Any command with a non-zero exit code to cause the script to fail.
set -o errexit
# Any reference to an undefined variable causes the script to fail.
