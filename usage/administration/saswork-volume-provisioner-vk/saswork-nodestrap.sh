#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script is designed to be run through a daemonset on Compute or CAS nodes
# in Viya to perform the necessary steps to have the SASWORK volume
# provisioned and ready for use. 

# Edit 06JUN2025 -- Rewrite the script to perform a better check of whether the block device is unused.

# The script is passed the following environment variables:
# - mountpath: The path to mount the SASWORK volume on the node. Default is /mnt/saswork.
# - subpaths: An array of subpaths to create under the mount path. If provided, the script will create a subdirectory for each subpath.
# - filesystem: The file system to use when formatting the new block device. Default is ext4.
# - blocksize: The block size to use when formatting with ext4. Default is 4096.
# - raiddev: The RAID device to create when striping multiple block devices together. Default is /dev/md0.
# - raidchunk: The chunk size to use when creating the RAID device. Default is 512.

## Customizations
# Mount path for the SASWORK volume on the node. If you change this you must also change the saswork-pv.yaml.
# Note that this must begin with /mnt when using an Azure SKU provided Temp disk, as these come pre-mounted to /mnt.
# mountpath=/mnt/saswork

# Subpaths: if this volume is being shared among multiple deployments (i.e. DEV and PROD on the same cluster),
# you can provide an array of subpaths so this provisioner will create a subdirectory in the mount path for each subpath.
# subpaths=( "dev" "prod" )

# File system to use when formatting the new block device. Can be ext4 or xfs.
# filesystem=ext4
# When formatting with ext4, which block size to use. The default value is 4096.
# blocksize=4096
# RAID device to create when striping multiple block devices together.
# raiddev=/dev/md0
# Chunk size to use when creating the RAID device. The default value is 512.
# raidchunk=512
## End Customizations

# The script performs the following actions:
# - Check if the mount path already exists and has the correct permissions and see if it is mounted directly to a block device, as would occur if the script was already run.
# - If the mount path exists:
# - - If the mount path is mounted to a block device (e.g. /dev/md0 or /dev/nvme0n1), it assumes the volume is already provisioned and exits.
# - - If the mount path is not mounted to a block device, it will perform its normal checks as if the mount path was not found to see if this path was not created by this script.
# - - If the checks determine that the mount path should not be mounted to a block device, it will correct the permissions to 777 and exit.
# - If the mount path does not exist:
# - - It will check for unused NVMe block devices
# - - - If it finds one, it will:
# - - - - format the device with the specified file system
# - - - - create the mount path
# - - - - mount the device to the mount path
# - - - - set the permissions of the mount path to 777
# - - - If it finds multiple unused NVMe block devices, it will:
# - - - - create a RAID device of the unused NVMe block devices
# - - - - format the RAID device with the specified file system
# - - - - create the mount path
# - - - - mount the RAID device to the mount path
# - - - - set the permissions of the mount path to 777
# - - If it does not find any unused NVMe block devices, it will check for unused non-NVMe block devices.
# - - - If it finds one, it will:
# - - - - format the device with the specified file system
# - - - - create the mount path
# - - - - mount the device to the mount path
# - - - - set the permissions of the mount path to 777
# - - - If it finds multiple unused non-NVMe block devices, it will:
# - - - - create a RAID device of the unused non-NVMe block devices
# - - - - format the RAID device with the specified file system
# - - - - create the mount path
# - - - - mount the RAID device to the mount path
# - - - - set the permissions of the mount path to 777
# - - If it does not find any unused block devices, it will create the mount path directory and set the permissions to 777.
