*Note:- Here <CASE_NO> will be the ServiceNow case number you will be entering.*

- Log: - /tmp/<CASE_NO>/
- TAR File: - /tmp/<CASE_NO>.tar.gz

To manually upload the tar file, follow the instructions in [KB0036136 - How to upload and download files using the SASTSDrive file sharing server](https://sas.service-now.com/csm?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0036136). You should then update the support request, stating that the logs are available. When completed, you can safely reclaim space in `/tmp` by removing the Logs and tar file.
